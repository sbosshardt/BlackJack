BlackJack
=========

BlackJack game written in C++ and OpenGL

This is a simple BlackJack program made by Sam Bosshardt.

I used DevC++ and OpenGL (and Glut)

Note: I didn't feel like creating each card image by hand, so the card images (stored in the images directory) this program uses came from: http://www.jfitz.com/cards/index.html

Another set of card faces came from: http://www.thehouseofcards.com/img/Deck-72x100x16.gif

Some of the winning and losing art uses these images from the web:

Some card backs came from the web:

All the other "art" was made by me

For image (PNG) handling I used SOIL, the Simple OpenGL Image Library.  It handles the dirty work of loading the images for showing the cards and other art.

Most of the audio was made by me using Audacity and my microphone.  The sound when you win a hand is the "Howard Dean scream".
